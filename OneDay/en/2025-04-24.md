**Relocation**

I arrived in Vietnam. It was spontaneous and very unusual.

There are no squares, only roads. The roads are noisy, full of bikes moving chaotically. I was afraid to use motorbike taxis. Outside, it’s hot and humid, there are no sidewalks, and crossing the streets feels like an act of bravery. Looking for food was tiring — maps didn’t match reality. A place could have a different schedule or not exist at all. Eating wherever I could didn’t help — the food was often sour, sweet, and spicy at once. My first month in Vietnam wasn’t easy.

But I didn’t run away from Vietnam. It was interesting and pulled me in.

Vietnam has beautiful nature, and you can ride a motorbike freely. You can drink coconuts on the beach all year round. There are cozy cafés with really good coffee. But that’s not the main thing. I didn’t just come to Vietnam — I left Russia. What matters most is not what Vietnam has, but what it doesn’t have.

Now I live in Vietnam. It is simple and deeply transformative.

When a tourist from Russia comes here, they often ask: how to stay safe, how to avoid trouble and aggression. But these questions are not really about Vietnam. They’re about what’s inside the person. They don’t feel calm and are afraid of new things. There’s always a path we don’t know yet, but we choose which one to take. For me, that path was Vietnam. And here, I started to feel more free and more confident. Because it’s people who shape what the streets feel like.

I’m learning from Vietnam. It’s emotional and deep.

Vietnamese people have a unique trait — their emotions are not demonstrative. On the outside, they are calm and friendly. This creates a peaceful feeling. With their own people, they maintain neighborly and often family-like relationships. They don’t interfere in others’ business, avoid open conflict, and usually express emotions through actions. I started smiling more myself and noticed: when you stay calm and kind, even difficult situations are easier to go through.

You try to be pleasant for another person — and they do the same for you.
