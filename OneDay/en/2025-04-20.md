**Sensitivity Changes the World**

Smile at people — strangers, taxi drivers, shopkeepers, doctors, friends, loved ones, anyone. Everyone deserves a kind word, a small act of support, or a genuine compliment. It truly matters — to all of us.

I turned 29 with gifts from people I barely knew. I brought a cake to a tea club meeting, not expecting any attention from those I had only seen once or twice before. But maybe that day, I really needed it. They gave me warmth and comfort, and made the next day feel brighter.

We never truly know what someone might need. But maybe those five seconds of sensitivity could shape years to come. It’s always worth a try.
